# Pickle-to-JSON

A simple tool for converting .pkl data files into .json format

# How to use?
Place the Pickle (.pkl) file in the same directory as this file and run the following command:

```python
python pickle-to-json.py demo.pkl
```
Replace **demo.pkl** with the name of your file.

That's it! The script will create a new .JSON file in the same folder.
